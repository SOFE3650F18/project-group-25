# Iteration 1

*This section presents the results of the activities that are performed in each of the steps of ADD in the first iteration of the design process.*

## ADD Step 1: Review Inputs

The first step of the ADD method involves reviewing the inputs and identifying which requirements will be considered as drivers (i.e., which will be included in the design backlog). The inputs are summarized in the following table.

| Category                        | Details                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Design purpose                  | This is a greenfield system from a mature domain. The system is new but is based off of existing patterns and styles. |
| Primary functional requirements | From the use cases above, the primary ones are:<li>UC - 1: Because it supports the core business <li> UC - 7: Because it supports the core business <li>UC - 8:  Because it supports the core business. <li>UC - 9: Because it supports somewhat administrative functions for the lecturers and administrators can even use those functions. <li>UC - 10: Because it supports core business. <li>UC - 15: Because it supports back up of historical data. <li>UC - 16: Because it supports fetching backed up data. <li> UC - 18: Because it supports administrative functions for administrators. <li> UC - 20:  Because it supports administrative functions for administrators. |
| Quality attribute scenarios     |                                                              <table><tr><th>Scenario ID</th><th>Importance to customer </th><th>Difficulty to implement according to architecture</th></tr><tr><td>QA-1</td><td>High</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td>QA-2</td><td>High</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>QA-3</td><td>Medium</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>QA-4</td><td>High</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td>QA-5</td><td>High</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td>QA-6</td><td>High</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>QA-7</td><td>Medium</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td>QA-8</td><td>Medium</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>QA-9</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>QA-10</td><td>Medium</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>QA-11</td><td>High</td><td>High</td></tr></table><br>Quality attributes QA - 1, QA - 2, QA - 4, QA - 5, QA - 6, QA - 7, and QA - 11 are selected as drivers.|
| Constraints                     | All constraints discussed are included as drivers.           |
| Concerns                        | All concerns discussed are included as drivers.              |
