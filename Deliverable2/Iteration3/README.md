# Iteration 3

*In this iteration of the ADD process, the aim is to address quality attribute driver QA - 6.*

## ADD Step 2: Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers

The goal of this iteration is to focus on the quality attribute QA - 6 where the scenario is ‘ Restore most recent backup of data if system failures occur or the system is being updated’.  So if a update is needed to be done to the system or the system crashes, the most recent data of the system needs to be used temporarily while in the background, the system would be fixed or updated. The drivers are all the ones that were not addressed or partially addressed in the second iteration.

## ADD Step 3: Choose one or more elements of the System to Refine
This scenario is mostly based on availability, backed up data would be available for the system to use while in the background the system is being fixed or updated. This scenario is also slightly addressing the systems ability to be maintainable and reliable. Refinement would need to be done on the following components mentioned in the first iteration:
- Application server
- Database server
